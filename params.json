It takes Memcached as the session datastore, which will boost the performance of your app. Also, it supports all the [original features](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/sessions.html), such as flash session.\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\n* [HU Yang Gang](https://github.com/cnsaturn), aka. Saturn\r\n\r\n## Requirement\r\n\r\n* PHP 5.2.0 +\r\n* CodeIgniter 2.0 +\r\n* [libmemcached php extension](http://pecl.php.net/package/memcached)\r\n\r\n## HOW TO USE?\r\n\r\n1.  Drop libraries/MY_Session.php into your application/libraries folder\r\n2.  Drop system/libraries/Cache folder into your system/libraries folder, overwrite the existing files if needed when prompted.\r\n3.  Load the Session library manually OR you can autoload it in config/autoload.php file.\r\n4.  Use it like you are using the original [CI Session library](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/sessions.html).\r\n5.  That's all, enjoy! \r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT license\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
